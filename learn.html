    <h1>Understanding the pieces</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt class="term">Pawn</dt>
            <dd>In chess, pawns are like foot soldiers they move forward one square at a time, 
                except for their very first move when they can go two squares forward. 
                Pawns capture enemy pieces by moving diagonally forward, but they can't capture straight ahead. 
                When a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it can turn into a stronger piece like a queen, 
                rook, knight, or bishop, which is called pawn promotion.</dd>
                <br>
            <dt class="term">Bishop</dt>
            <dd> The bishop is a powerful piece that moves diagonally across the board. It can capture enemy pieces that lie along its diagonal path. 
                Each player starts with two bishops one on light squares and one on dark squares</dd>
                <br>
            <dt class="term">Rook</dt>
            <dd> the rook is like a mighty tower that moves in straight lines, horizontally or vertically, as far as it wants. 
                It's great for controlling rows and columns, capturing enemy pieces, and teaming up with other pieces for powerful attacks.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt class="term">Knight</dt>
            <dd>The knight is like a tricky horse that moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to it. 
                It can jump over other pieces, making it great for sneaky maneuvers, capturing enemy pieces, and forking multiple targets at once.</dd>
                <br>
            <dt class="term">Queen</dt>
            <dd>The queen is like the boss of the chessboard, able to move in any direction—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—as far as it wants. 
                It's incredibly powerful for controlling the board, launching attacks, and defending your pieces. Just be careful not to expose your queen to attacks</dd>
                <br>
            <dt class="term">King</dt>
            <dd>The king is the most important piece, it moves one square in any direction, but be careful <strong>it's the target of the game.</strong>
                Protect your king at all costs, if it's ever in danger of capture, move it out of harm's way or block the attacking piece.</dd>
